Overall, its not like i dislike the general vibe and the work its just that it won't be particularly interesting to me and it'd just be 'work' where i put in my 8 hours and go home.\n\nOn the other hand, I have another offer that is something that  I completely believe in. I'll be making an actual impact in someone's life. However, this isn't a tech startup like the other one. I won't have any stocks or bonuses, and i'm taking a paycut to the tune of 40%. Most of the people are older but its a lot more serious. I'd be working on very interesting and impactful projects.\n\nI've been talking to my friends. Many of my friends in tech told me that if I don't take the former company, i'd be such an idiot especially since i spent SO long on interview prep- it'd be a shame to throw it all away for nothing. However, many of my older friends who don't do software development told me that when i get older, i'm going to regret not following my passion and instead deciding to go where the money takes me as I won't be destitute in either case, it's more a matter of the difference between upper-middle class/lower upper class to solidly middle class. \n\nA lot of my younger tech friends already at FAANG and stuff told me that it doesn't really matter if i'm interested or not in the job- it pays well and having fun is what weekends are for especially if i have a lot of money to augment it. They also said something that made me really think: it's just a job and so many of people on earth are in jobs that they just see as jobs and aren't even that passionate about. Why must i be different? I'm honestly considering taking the former offer because I can put a lot more money towards purchasing a house in the future and have more 'fun' money for trips and such.\n\nHowever, my older friends have asked me this one pertinent question - i'm strictly childfree and will not be looking to have children anytime in my life, so why do i need to amass so much wealth in the first place? Housing is nice and all but at one point it turns from a pretty house to more 'house' to clean. They also said that at one point, i'm going to get sick of it and want to move. I'm not proud of this but I brushed off their comments and just kind of scoffed but now i'm having more doubts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

However, many of my older friends who don&amp;#39;t do software development told me that when i get older, i&amp;#39;m going to regret not following my passion and instead deciding to go where the money takes me as I won&amp;#39;t be destitute in either case, it&amp;#39;s more a matter of the difference between upper-middle class/lower upper class to solidly middle class. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of my younger tech friends already at FAANG and stuff told me that it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter if i&amp;#39;m interested or not in the job- it pays well and having fun is what weekends are for especially if i have a lot of money to augment it. They also said something that made me really think: it&amp;#39;s just a job and so many of people on earth are in jobs that they just see as jobs and aren&amp;#39;t even that passionate about. Why must i be different? I&amp;#39;m honestly considering taking the former offer because I can put a lot more money towards purchasing a house in the future and have more &amp;#39;fun&amp;#39; money for trips and such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, my older friends have asked me this one pertinent question - i&amp;#39;m strictly childfree and will not be looking to have children anytime in my life, so why do i need to amass so much wealth in the first place? Housing is nice and all but at one point it turns from a pretty house to more &amp;#39;house&amp;#39; to clean. They also said that at one point, i&amp;#39;m going to get sick of it and want to move. I&amp;#39;m not proud of this but I brushed off their comments and just kind of scoffed but now i&amp;#39;m having more doubts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? Have you ever been in this predicament before? Especially older women in tech- are my older friends right? Will i regret it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2v7hs", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "dssovz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "girlsgonewiredthrow", "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/girlsgonewired/comments/dssovz/having_you_ever_sold_out_for_more_money_before/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/dssovz/having_you_ever_sold_out_for_more_money_before/", "subreddit_subscribers": 12502, "created_utc": 1573102378.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 21, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "girlsgonewired", "selftext": "Any ladies here interested in learning more about amping up their project management skills to help lead technical projects better?", "author_fullname": "t2_ju70j5y", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Technical Project Management", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/girlsgonewired", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_dshi58", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "steward_reports": [], "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1573081418.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.girlsgonewired", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any ladies here interested in learning more about amping up their project management skills to help lead technical projects better?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2v7hs", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "dshi58", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ewoolf3", "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/girlsgonewired/comments/dshi58/technical_project_management/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/dshi58/technical_project_management/", "subreddit_subscribers": 12502, "created_utc": 1573052618.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 20, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "girlsgonewired", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_1ctvupi6", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Powertofy is going to do Virtual Career Remote Fair -

It was literally a huge group of people standing around, until somebody working there actually walked around and told us what to do.\n\n\n* Trash on tables between sessions, so you couldn't tell if seats are \u201ctaken\u201d by coffees or if it\u2019s just trash left behind. Like it wasn't a ton of trash, but there was at least one or two coffee cups left on each table when we went into new sessions, and you can't tell if that's a person trying to save a seat or if it's just garbage, but it turned out to just be garbage the majority of the time.\n\n\n* Somehow they didn't have enough printed stuff for certain sessions. You know how many people will be in the session, and even if you let in extra people, print out extra sheets to be prepared.\n\n\n* The food was very tasty IMO, but I'm pretty sure that you have to get food through the convention center or through a food company they may contract out to.\n\n\n* The food the first day of the conference had nothing for vegetarians other than a caesar salad. The second day they had two dishes for vegetarians other than salad.\n\n\n* They did record the sessions, and they were also insistent on people speaking into the microphones so they would be heard on the recordings and so that people who are hard of hearing could hear everything.\n\n\n* The staff members were very nice.\n\n* Today they didn't serve lunch until 2 p.m., which to me seemed pretty late, but that's a smaller detail for sure in the grand scheme of things.\n\n* The wifi actually worked well, which usually doesn't happen at a conference.\n\n* Lunch was included when you bought your ticket, which is cool.\n\n\n\n*The Content*\n\n\n* The conference wasn't really a women in Tech conference as much as it was a women in technical management conference. The majority of the talks focused on things like: how to run a team, the future of agile, why we need diversity and how a lack of diversity affect us, how to build trusting teams, and how to lead. Even the few that happened we're just at an incredibly high level, like very simplified, and they were about pretty broad &amp; popular topics like AI and ML, nothing really new or experimental or anything actually technical. The content of the presentations was great if you are in technical management or are a woman in a tech company in a non engineering position, but if you are an engineer, don't expect to learn any hard skills at this conference. For a women in **tech** conference, this conference was incredibly non-technical.\n\n\n* Some of the speakers were VERY good. Please note that I'm not knocking the speakers themselves as a whole. My last bullet was specifically about the content over all of the conference, and the spread, or lack thereof, of different topics.\n\n\n* Two of the keynote presentations weren't really relevant or presenting about anything that was useful. I remember sitting there thinking, why is this person giving **this** presentation right now, and why is it a **keynote**?\n\n* Three other keynote speakers were very inspiring and had very relevant presentations.\n\n\n* There were a number of presentations explaining why diversity is important and how diversity can bring good things for your company and product, but at a certain point it's like, if I'm at a women in Tech conference I'm not likely the person that needs to be convinced that we need more women in tech (and there's only so much I can do about this issue in my company), and I especially don't need five different presentations on that same topic at the same conference. I know that sounds really goofy to say because I do want more women in tech, but I'm not the one that needs convincing, so the same topic over and over was repetitive and not super helpful.\n\n\n*To sum up:*\n\n\nIf you are a woman in an engineering position and have ever gone to the Grace Hopper conference, absolutely don't bother going to this unless someone (work or school) pays for it all.\n\nIf you are a woman in tech who is not in an engineering job, this conference has useful information, but a number of the topics are things that have been presented about a lot before, so if you've ever gone to another women in tech type conference, this one will be a bit repetitive.\n\n\nIf you can't go to the Grace Hopper conference for whatever reason, this is okay to go to if your job or school pays for it because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't say this is worth flying to or paying for yourself.
