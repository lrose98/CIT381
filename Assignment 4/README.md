### Assignment 4

Instructions below
-----
#### Alumni Website
You've been asked to create a database schema for an alumni website. Initially, you're given the following list of web pages:

- Home – landing page, major highlights, courses, success stories, statistics and numbers
- Join – registration by email address (ensure not campus email address as may expire), requires acceptance
- Login/Update – member contact/information update
- Events – CIT-related events (past, upcoming)
- Blog – monthly article by staff or alumni members
- Contact
- Create a list of objects (entities) that would be required to deliver the functionality from the list of web pages. From this list of entities, create a list of tables that corresponds with these entities. Use MySQL Workbench to create a model with all of these entities. For each table, add an appropriate primary key (surrogate or natural).

Save the model as **cit381-assign04-alumni.mwb.**

Export the model schema as an SQL file called **cit381-assign04-alumni.sql.**

Pick three of the the tables (at least one with a relationship), and add any necessary properties and relationships. All relationships must also include relationship labels.

To help with the properties and relationships, create a list of relationship "rules" that correlate with these three tables. Write out each rule using language similar to the boat-sailor examples on Canvas. You should have at least two rules for each relationship (relationships are bidirectional).

Save these rules as **cit381-assign04-alumni-rules.txt.**

Update your model mwb file, and re-export the SQL schema.

Export a PNG image of the model, and save the image as **cit381-assign04-alumni.png.**

#### Queries
- Write at least five queries that select data from the tables.
- One of the queries must involve the two tables involved in a relationship.
- One of the queries must use a subquery.
- Save the queries in a file called **cit381-assign04-alumni-queries.sql.**
